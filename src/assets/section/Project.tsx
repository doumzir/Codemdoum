During this year, I was able to create a website for Betclim. I initially built a first version using WordPress to quickly establish an online presence. Later on, I developed a second version using NextJS, Sass, TypeScript, and NodeJS (TS). To create this second version, I started by using Figma and Photoshop for basic designs and mockups. Once I had gathered enough design elements, I transitioned directly to programming.This experience allowed me to learn about the Next.js environment, deployment on Vercel, and to enhance my skills in TypeScript and React in general.',
